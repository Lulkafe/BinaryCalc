# Binary Calculator 
A simple calculator for binaries. \
You can directly flip them by clicking and see the result.

A demo is available [here](https://lulkafe.github.io/BinaryCalc/)

## Motivation behind this project
When I was working on an embedded system project, \
I wished to have an app to show/manipulate binaries in a more visual and interactive way. \
So, I made this app.
