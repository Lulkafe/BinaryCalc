# Binary Calculator 
A simple calculator for binaries, \
but you can manipulate binaries and immediately see the result.

The demo is available [here](https://lulkafe.github.io/BinaryCalc/)

## Motivation behind this project
When I was working on an embedded system project, \
I wished to have an app to represent/manipulate binaries in a more visual and interactive way. \
So, the idea came from that experience.
